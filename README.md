## Overview ##

This Extension for the [Microsoft Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) text editor enhances Electric Imp application development by delivering access to the Electric Imp impCloud™ via the [Electric Imp impCentral™ API](https://developer.electricimp.com/tools/impcentralapi). It allows you to rapidly build and maintain applications by providing:

* Code auto-completion for [Electric Imp’s imp API](https://developer.electricimp.com/api).
* The ability to use a source control system to manage application code and configuration.
* Advanced Squirrel code highlighting.
* Integration with [impWorks™ Builder](https://developer.electricimp.com/tools/builder) to enable multi-file projects and code pre-processing.
* Live logs with clickable stack traces for errors, and navigation to the file and line in question.
* Key shortcuts for frequently performed operations (build and run, show console, etc).
* Leverages Visual Studio Code’s rich set of features.

### Requirements ###

For operation, the Extension requires a connection to the Internet. It also requires Node.js, impWorks Builder and Visual Studio Code.

## Installation ##

### 1. Install Node.js ###

The Extension requires Node.js 11.0 or above. Please follow [these instructions](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/) to install Node on your machine.

### 2. Install The Builder Node.js Module ###

The Extension uses the [Builder Node.js module](https://github.com/electricimp/Builder) for source code pre-processing. To install Builder, please use Node Package Manager (NPM):

```bash
npm i -g Builder
```

### 3. Install Visual Studio Code ###

Visual Studio Code can be [downloaded for a variety of platforms here](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).

### 4. Install The Visual Studio Code Extension ###

The Electric Imp Visual Studio Code Extension can be installed using any of a number of methods, listed below. Once the Extension has been published to the [Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/VSCode), this will be the recommended way to install the Extension by building it from the source code.

#### Installation From The Visual Studio Marketplace ####

The [Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/VSCode) can be accessed through Visual Studio Code itself. Please refer to the Marketplace [documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/extension-gallery) for more details. Search for the extension using `"Electric Imp Squirrel"` and, when the extension is listed, click the **Install** button next to it in the search results.

#### Installation From Source ####

Follow these steps to install the Extension manually:

1. At the command line, `cd` to the Visual Studio Code extension directory:
    - **macOS** *~/.vscode/extensions*
    - **Windows** *%USERPROFILE%\\.vscode\extensions*
2. Clone the [full GitHub source repository](https://github.com/electricimp/vscode.git).
3. Run `npm install .`
4. Restart Visual Studio Code.

## Visual Studio Code Extension Usage ##

### Create A New Project ###

Select a new project working directory using **File > Open Folder...**, if you have not done so. Select the **View > Command Palette... > imp: New Project** menu item.

When you create new project (or perform any other action that requires access to the Electric Imp impCloud), you will be asked to:

- Provide your impCentral API base URL. The default value should be used, unless you are working with a Private impCloud.
- Provide your Electric Imp account user name, password and one-time password (OTP) as needed.
- Specify whether a new Product should be created or an existing one selected for the project.
- Select an impCentral account for the project from a list of accounts available for the user. Please see [‘impCentral Collaborator Account Access’](https://developer.electricimp.com/tools/impcentral/collaboratoractions) for more details.
- Specify whether a new Device Group should be created or an existing one selected for the project.

The project directory will be set up with the following files and structure:

```
<project working directory>
  |----> settings                   - Settings directory
  .   |--> auth.info                - SENSITIVE impCentral API tokens and 
  .   |                               GitHub authentication information
  .   |--> imp.config               - Generic Electric Imp settings
  .
  |----> src                        - Source code directory
  .   |--> device.nut               - Device code file
  .   |--> agent.nut                - Agent code file
  .
  |---->.gitignore                  - .gitignore file to exclude auth.info file 
                                      from git repository
```

**IMPORTANT** The file `auth.info` in the `settings` sub-directory should not be put under source control as it contains sensitive account information. A `.gitignore` file is included automatically to prevent this.

The `imp.config` file contains:

- A unique user identifier.
- A unique Device Group identifier.
- Device and agent code file names.
- [Builder](https://developer.electricimp.com/tools/builder) settings.

#### Example ####

```json
{ "cloudURL"       : "<Electric Imp impCloud URL>",
  "ownerID"        : "<user ID>",
  "deviceGroupId"  : "<device group ID>",
  "device_code"    : "<path to device source file; src/device.nut by default>",
  "agent_code"     : "<path to agent source file; src/agent.nut by default>",
  "builderSettings": "<different Builder variables>" }
```

When a project is created, empty device and agent code files (`device.nut` and `agent.nut`, respectively) are automatically created and stored in the project working directory’s `src` sub-directory.

If the project was created successfully, the `imp.config` file is opened.

#### Important Notes ####

- If the project working directory is not open in Visual Studio Code, no Extension commands will work. Use **File > Open Folder...** to open the directory.
- The code which is deployed to a Device Group is pre-processed and therefore may contain line control markers. 
- When you select an existing Device Group, the Extension downloads the code currently deployed to the group, but doesn’t transfer this code to the project file/directory structure.
- If you are working with collaborators on a project, please share the original Electric Imp Extension project sources/structure via a source control system.

### Open An Existing Project ###

To open an existing project, use **File > Open Folder...** to open the project working directory.

### Build And Run Code ###

To build code and deploy it, use **View > Command Palette... > imp: Deploy Project**.

This action pre-processes and then uploads the agent and the device code to the impCloud™ server. Finally, it restarts all of the devices assigned to the target Device Group. 

If you want to run your code on specific devices and view the logs from those devices, you need to select them using **View > Command Palette... > imp: Add Device to current DG**. The **imp: Remove Device from current DG** command removes a device from the project’s Device Group.

**Note** It isn’t necessary to assign a device to the Device Group to build and deploy your code to the group. If you don’t have any devices assigned to the Device Group, you can still work on the code and see any compilation errors reported by the server.

### The Log Console ###

Live logs are streamed to the console, displayed by selecting the **View > Output** menu item. It is possible to add a specific device to the live logs by its ID using the **View > Command Palette... > imp: Start Device Logs** command. The console shows live logs streamed from the current Device Group if the group contains at least one device.

### Assign A Device To The Project Device Group ###

To assign devices to the project’s Device Group, select **View > Command Palette... > imp: Add Device to current DG**.

### Unassign A Device From The Project Device Group ###

Devices can be removed from the project’s Device Group by selecting **View > Command Palette... > imp: Remove Device from current DG**.

### Retrieve An Agent URL ###

The URL of a device’s agent can be retrieved by selecting **View > Command Palette... > imp: Get agent URL**. The URL is displayed in a dialog box and copied to the clipboard.

### Extension Keyboard Shortcuts ###

**Note** Electric Imp-specific menu items are only available if an Electric Imp project is open in the currently active window.

| Command | Shortcut |
| ------- | -------- |
| Show all Extension Commands | Ctrl + Shift + C |
| Create Project | Ctrl + Shift + Y |
| Build and Run | Ctrl + Shift + X |

## Pre-processor And Multiple File Support ##

Please refer to the [Builder documentation](https://developer.electricimp.com/tools/builder) for more information on the pre-processor syntax that you can use in your Squirrel code.

### Specify GitHub Authentication Information ###

Please use the `<project working directory>/settings/auth.info` file to specify your Builder GitHub authentication information:

```json
{ ...,
  "builderSettings": { "github_user"  : "GitHub user name",
                       "github_token": "Personal access token or password" }}
```

### Specify Builder Preset Variable Definitions ###

Please use the `<project working directory>/settings/imp.config` file to specify Builder variable definitions (as [described here](https://developer.electricimp.com/tools/builder#builder-expressions)).

```json
{ "builderSettings": { ...,
                       "variable_definitions": { "IntType": 34,
                                                 "FloatType": 34.456,
                                                 "ExponentType1": 3E4,
                                                 "ExponentType2": 3e-2,
                                                 "StringType1": "str1",
                                                 "StringType2": "\"str2\"",
                                                 "BoolTypeTrue": true,
                                                 "BoolTypeFalse": false,
                                                 "NullType": null },
                                        ... }}
```

It is possible to obtain these Builder variable definitions values from Squirrel code this way:

```squirrel
server.log(@{IntType});       // 34
server.log(@{FloatType});     // 34.456
server.log(@{ExponentType1}); // 30000
server.log(@{ExponentType2}); // 0.03
server.log(@{StringType1});   // str1
server.log(@{StringType2});   // "str2"
server.log(@{BoolTypeTrue});  // true
server.log(@{BoolTypeFalse}); // false
server.log(@{NullType});      // (null : 0x0)
server.log(@{NotDefined});    // (null : 0x0)
```
